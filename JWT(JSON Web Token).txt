JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is often used for authentication and authorization purposes in web development. The typical flow involves a client (such as a web browser or mobile app) sending credentials to a server, which then issues a JWT upon successful authentication. The client can include this JWT in subsequent requests to access protected resources.

JWT authentication Functioning:

1) User Authentication:
a) The user provides their credentials to the server.
b) The server validates the credentials, and if they are correct, it generates a JWT.

2)JWT Generation:
a) The server creates a JSON object containing a set of claims.
b) The claims here means information about the user (subject, username, user role, etc.) and metadata.
c) The server signs the JSON object with a secret key to create the JWT.

3) JWT Issuance:
a) The server sends the JWT back to the client.

4)Client Usage:
a) The client includes the JWT in the Authorization header.
b) The server verifies the JWT's signature using the secret key.
c) If the signature is valid, the server extracts the claims from the JWT and uses them to authenticate and authorize the client.
